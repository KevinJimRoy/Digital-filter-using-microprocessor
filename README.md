Bidirectional UART communication at 115200 baud

Interrupt-driven processing on the NXP KL25Z board

Input signal:
x(t) = 127 + 80·sin(2π·10·t) + 8·sin(2π·100·t) (8-bit values)

Digital low-pass filter designed in MATLAB using butter function

DAC output of the filtered signal for analog observation

Signal logging: Both unfiltered and filtered signals saved to CSV on PC

MATLAB plotting of signal data for visualization
